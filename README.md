# flappy-dragon

Flappy Bird clone impleneted in Rust for learning puproses while following [Herbert Wolverson's Hands-on Rust](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55961302-hands-on-rust) (check it out!).
Also extended the exercise while reading Herbert's [blog post](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/flappy-dragon-rust-647e91a34dd4) and done other minor tweeks and improvements.

The original game art is from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/flappy-dragon-sprite-sheets).

This is basically the "Hello, World!" of game development. But I had a fun time writing it nontheless!

## How to play the game?
- install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- clone the repo
- `cd` into it.
- `cargo run`
